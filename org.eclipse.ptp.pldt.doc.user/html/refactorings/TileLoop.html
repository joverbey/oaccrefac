<h3><b>Tile Loops</b></h3>

<h3>Use:</h3>
<p>Traditionally, tiling is used to ensure that data used in a loop is kept in the cache.
On a GPU, a &quot;strided&quot; variant of tiling can be used to assign multiple loop
iterations to a single thread while ensuring that adjacent iterations are assigned to
different threads (for memory coalescing).</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Traditional tiling executes Strip Mining and Interchange on a two-dimensional iteration space to then iterate in blocks.  The strided variant executes a Strip Mine and Interchange on a one-dimensional iteration to then iterate in blocks.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the desired for loop to be changed and choose Tiling under the Refactoring menu.</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/Tiling/Tiling1Final.png">
<li>Next make sure Tiling is selected and then enter the desired height and width.</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/Tiling/Tiling2Final.png">
<li>The resulting for loop.</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/Tiling/Tiling3Final.png">
<li>If strided tiling is desired please make sure that its selected and enter the stride width.</li>

<li>The resulting for loop.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h3>Restrictions:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Must be a two-dimensional perfectly nested loop structure</li>
<li>Loop may not have a pragma attached to it.</li>
<li>The selected loop cannot carry dependence in the less than direction and be in the greater than direction after interchange as occurred.</li>
<li>The selected loop cannot carry dependence in the greater than direction and be in the less than direction after interchange as occurred.</li>
