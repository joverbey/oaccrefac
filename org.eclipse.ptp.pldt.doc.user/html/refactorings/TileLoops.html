TileLoops
</title>

<p><b>Description:</b> Executes a Strip Mine and Interchange on a two-dimensional iteration to then iterate in in blocks.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b>
<ul>
<li>1. Select the desired for loop to be changed and choose Tiling under the Refactoring menu.</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/Tiling/Tiling1Final.png">
<li>2. Next you will be prompted...</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/Tiling/Tiling2Final.png">
<li>3. The resulting for loop.</li>

</ul>
<p><b>Use:</b> Ensures that data used in a loop is kept in the cache until it needs to be reused and eliminates cache size requirements.</p>

<p><b>Restrictions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Must be a two-dimensional perfectly nested loop structure</li>
<li>2. Loop may not have a pragma attached to it.</li>
<li>3. The selected loop cannot carry dependence in the less than direction and be in the greater than direction after interchange as occurred.</li>
<li>4. The selected loop cannot carry dependence in the greater than direction and be in the less than direction after interchange as occurred.</li>
</ul>

<body>
<p><b>Description:</b> Turns a single loop into two loops such that the array is iterated over in multiple small strips, and the strips are iterated over together in adjacent iteration. </p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Select the desired for loop to be changed and choose LoopCutting under the Refactoring menu.</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/LoopCutting/LoopCutting1.png">
<li>2. Next you will be prompted for the size of the cut.</li>
<img src="../images/refactorings/LoopCutting/LoopCutting2.png">
<li>3. The resulting for loop.</li>
