<p>&nbsp;
<!--  ============= -->
<p>This section describes how to set up a simple <i>local</i> C/C++ project for MPI.
A local project exists on the local machine (same machine on which Eclipse is installed).
See also the information about creating synchronized projects, where source code etc. is mirrored on the
local machine as well as a remote target on which you can build and run the program.
For another sample project creation example using synchronized projects, see
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/01buildMPIprog.html">Introduction to MPI projects (synchronized and local)</a>
<p>
There are several ways to set up the MPI information in an Eclipse C/C++/Fortran project:
<ul><li>Managed Build Projects
<ul>
<li><a href="#wizard">Use the PLDT new project wizards</a>
</li>
<li><a href="#manual">Add the MPI build information manually</a>
</ul>

<li>Makefile projects 
<ul>
<li><a href="setupMakefileProject.html">Set up MPI information in a Makefile project</a>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>You should see <a href="includes.html">A Word about Include Paths and MPI Preferences</a> for a discussion about the different
ways you can set up your project, including the MPI Preferences, 
to find the include paths for build as well as for other Eclipse tools.

<!--  ============= -->
<h2>Terminology of CDT projects: Managed Build vs. Makefile Projects</h2>
<p>Note: the older versions of CDT (4.0 and earlier)
refer to a C project in which it manages the makefile as  a "Managed Make Project" or a "Managed Build Project."
They refer to a project which 
you supply the makefile is a "Standard Make project".
<p>The current version of CDT that works with PTP 7.0 is CDT 8.2.
CDT 5.0 and later refers to a C project in which it manages the makefile as just a "C Project" and a project which 
you supply the makefile is a <a href="setupMakefileProject.html">"Makefile project."</a>
<p>Both terminologies are sometimes used in these instructions.

<h2 id="wizard">Use the PLDT new project wizards</h2>

<p>One way to create a new MPI C project is to use the menu: File->New->C project (if you are already in the C/C++ perspective this may be the simplest).
There are several other ways to get to this wizard (including context menu in the Project Explorer view). 
<p>In the first wizard dialog page, "C Project,"
enter a project name; under Project types, expand 'executable' and select, e.g. "MPI Hello World C project"
<p>Note: be sure to select a valid toolchain on the right side of this dialog.  Your system may provide different toolchains,
and the selection may be different from what is shown here.

<p>&nbsp;
<p>Select Next to go to the next page of the New Project Wizard.

<br>On the Basic Settings page of the wizard, fill in any project template values, e.g. your name
in the Author field.
The Author is simply used in a comment in the file.  The "Hello World greeting" is used in the sample statement
in the code that is generated.  The "Source" field indicates the name of the source folder that is generated in the project.
<br>Then select Next.
<br><img src="images/mpiWizard2.gif">
<p>On the next page, "MPI Project Settings" page,  the "Add MPI project settings to this project" should be checked.
If you want to change any of the default values for this project, you can do so
here by unchecking the "Use default information" and altering the values.
The default values were chosen based on  input to the PLDT MPI Preferences page.
To have a specific include path added to all new MPI projects, see <a href="#reco">below</a>
for how to specify the MPI Include path in the Preferences.

<br><img src="images/mpiWizard3.gif">
<p>Select Finish.
<p>The project is created and should build automatically.
The Eclipse workbench is shown below after creating the new "MPI hello world" project.
The project explorer view on the left shows the project contents.
The source file is under the 'src' directory; expand this to see it.
Double-click on the source file name to edit the source file.  The outline view on the
right shows the outline of the file currently shown in the editor.
The Console view at the bottom shows the results of the project build.

<p>
<h2 id="manual">Add the Build Information Manually</h2>
<p>If the new project wizard isn't used as described 
above to set the MPI information for a project,
the MPI information can be added to the project manually as follows.
<ol>
<li>Create a C project 
<ul>

<li>Note: the following description is for a regular C project (also known as a "Managed Build" CDT project).
For information about Makefile projects, in which you provide the makefile yourself, 
see <a href="setupMakefileProject.html">Setup for Makefile projects</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Set up the include paths etc:
<br>To bring up the Project Properties, rightMouse on the project name, and select "Properties" (at the bottom of the context menu list)
<br>Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, Directories
<br>--> Add include path for mpi header files etc. - path to the 'include' dir
<br><img src="images/include.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>
Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, GCC C Linker, Libraries
<ol>
<li>Under "Libraries (-l)"  add the symbol "mpi"  
<li> Under "Library search path (-L)" add the path to the 'lib' dir in MPI dir.
<br><img src="images/lib.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<li><b>MPI Build Command:</b> Note: If you have an MPI installed that requires a different
build command, such as 'mpicc' instead of 'gcc', specify it here as well.
Select the compiler tool on the left and modify the 'Command:' value.
You probably also need to do the same for the linker tool.
<br><img src="images/mpiBuildCommand.png">
</ol>
<p>

</ol>
<p>Note that the above instructions describe how to add information to C projects in which the makefile is generated for you,
previously known as "Managed Build" projects.  If you provide your own makefile, you will create a "Makefile project"
and create the makefile within that project.
See <a href="setupMakefileProject.html">Setting up project properties for a Makefile project</a>.

<h3 id="reco">Recognizing Artifacts by prefix, vs Include path</h3>   
<p><b>Note:</b> if you have modified the MPI Preferences to <b>Uncheck</b> "Recognize MPI Artifacts by prefix (MPI) alone?"
then the header file must be located for MPI artifacts to be recognized. 
<p><img src="images/recognize-mpi-prefix.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>So if
you are <i>not</i> recognizing MPI artifacts by prefix alone, then PLDT will have to use include files to
identify MPI artifacts. If you have not set the MPI includes on the MPI Preferences page yet, 
you'll be prompted after the first page in the new project wizard dialog:
<br><img src="images/mpiPrefsHaveNotBeenSet.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>See <a href="includes.html">A word about includes and MPI preferences</a>
for more information and how to fill this in.
 

<p>&nbsp;
<p>Now continue to set up to <a href="run.html">run the MPI tools</a>
