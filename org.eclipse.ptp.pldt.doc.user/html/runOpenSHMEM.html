<h1 id="top"> Running the OpenSHMEM Tools within the Parallel Language Development Tools</h1>

<!--  <p>The Parallel Language Development Tools work on C, C++, and Fortran projects.
-->
<ol>
<li>Within the project, create a source file that includes OpenSHMEM code.
<li>In the Project Explorer View, select the source file to analyze, to find the OpenSHMEM artifacts.
To do this, select the source file in the Project Explorer on the left to highlight it.
<p>Select the "Show OpenSHMEM Artifacts" menu item in the PLDT icon menu  in the tool bar.
<br> <img src="images/pldt-menu-openSHMEM.png">
<br>(Note: if it complains that a source file is not selected the first time, select it again and retry.)
<p>The workbench with the selection and menu item is shown below:

<p><script> thumb("images/shmemButtons.png",300)</script>
<p>&nbsp;
<li>The OpenSHMEM Artifact View is opened, if it was not present.
It is populated with OpenSHMEM artifacts found.
<p><script> thumb("images/shmemViewAnn.png",300)</script>


<p>&nbsp;
<li>Double click on any line in the OpenSHMEM Artifact View
to navigate the editor to that line in the source file.
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Rows in the OpenSHMEM Artifact View can be sorted by any of the columns.
Select the column heading to sort.
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Select the "Clear OpenSHMEM Artifacts Markers" button (red X)
in the tool bar <i>of the OpenSHMEM Artifact View</i> to remove all
the OpenSHMEM artifact markers.

<p>&nbsp;
<li>You can run the analysis on another file and its markers
will be added to the view.
<p>&nbsp;
<li>You can run the analysis on more than one file (multiple selection)
or a container (folder or project), to analyze more than one file at a time.
Click on a project or a folder, then select the
"Show OpenSHMEM Artifacts" action
 to run it on all C source files in that folder.

<p>&nbsp;
<li><b>Hover Help</b><br>
In the editor, hover over an OpenSHMEM api and a popup box shows details of that API.
<br><img src="images/shmemHoverHelp.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<li><b>Content Assist</b><br>
Type an incomplete OpenSHMEM function name e.g. "shmem_"
and hit Ctrl-Space. The information that is shown
is populated with CDT completions including argument
types, but in addition, the PTP-OpenSHMEM tools also provide
specific information about actual OpenSHMEM functions
where appropriate, and a yellow popup with additional 
textual descriptive information about the function.
Pick the one you want with the arrow keys or the mouse, to add the API to your source file.

a function name, a help view appears which shows additional information.
