<h2 id=include>A Word about Include Paths</h2>
<p>There are several places where you can set up include paths, e.g. MPI include paths, in Eclipse. 
<ul>
<li><a href="#prefs">PLDT Preferences</a> - used to assist in artifact location, and can be automatically added to build path of new projects
<li><a href="#build">Build Settings</a> - added to the build path when your project is compiled
<li><a href="#genl">General Settings</a> - used by Eclipse and CDT for indexing so the editor can find things, if the above are not available
</ul>
<p>For MPI projects, most MPI tools replace the build command with <code>mpicc</code> or a similar command, which sets compiler
options including the include path.  So you don't really need the include path set for <i>building</i> an MPI project.
<p>However, Eclipse <i>does</i> need to know where the header file is located, for the indexer to be able to calculate the
location of the MPI APIs among other things.
<h2>If the Indexer can't find your include file </h2>
<p>If the indexer can't find your MPI header file, you may see problems like the following:
<br>
<img src="images/mpiNotFound.png">
<p>If your MPI header file is located in a global area that automatically gets included in your project's include path location, such as
<code>/usr/include</code> or <code>/usr/local/include</code>, then things will probably work just fine without further alteration.
Building and indexing will probably both operate correctly.
<p>If you do not use mpicc or a similar build command and need to specify include and libpath information on building and
linking, you will probably want to set the PLDT preferences to point to your include path for MPI, in which case, the include
and link arguments will be added to your build commands.

<h2 id="prefs">Includes and PLDT Preferences</h2>
<p>If you set the include files in the PLDT Preferences, then when you create a new MPI project, include and link arguments will added to the build commands, 
the Indexer will find your header files, and new MPI projects will be automatically set up this way.
<p>To open Preferences, use the menu
<ul>
<li>On a Mac, Eclipse > Preferences
<li>On other OSs including Windows and Linux, Window > Preferences
</ul>
<p>In the Preferences dialog, select Parallel Tools > Parallel Language Development Tools > MPI.


<p>
<img src="images/pldt-prefs-mpi.png">
<p>This preference page also lets you set the build command for new MPI projects.  If you add an include path here
(via the "New..." button), it will be added to the build command and your Eclipse project will find it as well.  It will
also make an estimate of the link lib location and arguments.
<p>If you have unchecked the "Recognize MPI Artifacts by Prefix alone", then 
the "Prompt to include MPI APIs found in other locations (C only)" indicates whether 
it will ask you if MPI APIS found elsewhere 
will be considered as artifacts.  For example, if you point to &lt;install-loc&gt;/include in the MPI include paths here,
but your source files actually include header files from /usr/local/include, it will prompt you to consider these as well 
during the analysis.
This last option is only valid for C projects, not C++ projects.
<p>Hit OK to close the Preferences dialog.
<p>See also <a href="">PLDT Preferences</a>

<p>However, if you use <code>mpicc</code> or another build command that does this for you, you don't need the include
and link arguments etc., and you may not like this.  See <a href="#genl">General Settings</a> below.
<p>&nbsp;
<h2 id="build">Build Settings</h2>
<p>The build settings allow you, for Managed Build projects, to set the include and link information used for the build.
To access the project build settings, bring up the Project Properties dialog
(In the Project Explorer view, Right mouse on the project name, and select, at the very bottom of the context menu, "Project Properties")
<br><img src="images/project-properties-menu.png">

<p>
and select C/C++ Build > Settings.
Under your compiler, select "Includes"  and under your Linker, select "Libraries"  to view and edit these values.
<img src="images/cdt-build-settings.png">
<p>To add one, select the "Add..." button
<p><img src="images/cdt-build-settings-addInclude.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>To see how this affects the build command, select e.g. the Compiler option and
view the arguments:
<p><img src="images/cdt-build-settings-view-command.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<h2 id="genl">General Settings</h2>
<p>If you use a build command (e.g. <code>mpicc</code>) that does includes for you,
you don't need this information added to the build, but you do need Eclipse to be able to find
your header file so that the Indexer, and tools that use this information, can find your header file.
<p>In the project properties, select C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols, and add the include path there.
This is used just within Eclipse, not for the build.
<p>They are also used both for Managed build projects as well as Makefile projects.
