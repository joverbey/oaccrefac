OpenACCCHelpBook_Description_acc_async_wait_all=Blocks until all asynchronous computations have completed.
OpenACCCHelpBook_Description_acc_free=Frees accelerator memory previously allocated by acc_malloc().
OpenACCCHelpBook_Description_acc_get_device_num=Returns the device number of the accelerator device of the given type that will be used to run the next parallel or kernels region.
OpenACCCHelpBook_Description_acc_get_device_type=Returns the type of accelerator device that will be used to run the next parallel and kernels region, or acc_device_none if a device has not been explicitly selected.
OpenACCCHelpBook_Description_acc_get_num_devices=Returns the number of attached accelerator devices that have the given type.
