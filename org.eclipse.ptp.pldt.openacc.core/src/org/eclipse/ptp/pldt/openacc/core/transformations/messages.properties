AbstractTileLoopsCheck_LoopFormNotSupported=Loop form not supported (not a 0-based counted loop).
ForLoopCheck_CannotAnalyzeDependences=Dependences could not be analyzed.  
ForLoopCheck_CannotRefactor=Cannot refactor loops containing break, continue, or goto
FuseLoopsCheck_CannotFuseDifferentPragmas=When a loop has a pragma associated with it, it cannot be fused unless both loops have identical pragmas.
FuseLoopsCheck_DefinitionsMayConflict=A definition of "%s" in the first loop may conflict with "%s" used in the second loop
FuseLoopsCheck_DependencesNotAnalyzed=Dependences could not be analyzed.  
FuseLoopsCheck_FusionCreatesDependence=These loops cannot be fused because doing so creates a dependence.
FuseLoopsCheck_MustBeTwoLoops=There is there must be two loops for fusion to be possible.
IntroOpenACCLoopCheck_CannotParallelizeCarriesDependence=This loop cannot be parallelized because it carries a dependence.
IntroOpenACCLoopCheck_KernelsCannotInParallelRegion=A kernels loop cannot be introduced in a parallel region.
IntroOpenACCLoopCheck_ParallelCannotInKernelsRegion=A parallel loop cannot be introduced in a kernels region.
IntroOpenACCLoopCheck_PragmaCannotBeAddedHasPragma=A pragma cannot be added to a loop that already has a pragma on it.
IntroRoutineCheck_CannotFindFunctionDefinition=Cannot find function definition.
LoopCuttingCheck_CannotCutCarriesDependence=This loop cannot be cut because it carries a dependence.
LoopCuttingCheck_DivisibleByIterationFactor=divisible by the intended loop's iteration factor.
LoopCuttingCheck_FactorMustBeGreater=LoopCut factor must be greater than and 
LoopCuttingCheck_InvalidCutFactor=Invalid cut factor (<= 0).
LoopCuttingCheck_NameAlreadyExists=Index variable name already exists in scope.
StripMineCheck_FactorMustBeGreaterAndDivisible=Strip mine factor must be greater than and divisible by the intended loop's iteration factor
StripMineCheck_InnerNameAlreadyExists=Inner index variable name already exists in scope
StripMineCheck_InvalidStripFactor=Invalid strip factor (<= 0)
StripMineCheck_OuterNameAlreadyExists=Outer index variable name already exists in scope
StripMineCheck_OverflowWillOccur=Loop range overflow will not be handled, but the loop upper bound is not divisible by strip factor, so overflow will occur
TileLoopsCheck_HeightMustBe=Height must be at least 1
TileLoopsCheck_LoopContainsPragma=This loop contains an ACC pragma.
TileLoopsCheck_MustBeTwoLoops=There must be two nested loops to perform loop tiling.
TileLoopsCheck_OnlyPerfectlyNestedLoops=Only perfectly nested loops can be tiled.
TileLoopsCheck_WidthMustBe=Width must be at least 1
