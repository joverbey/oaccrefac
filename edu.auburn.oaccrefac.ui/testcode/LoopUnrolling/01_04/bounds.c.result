/*
 * This test should demonstrate a simple refactoring
 * of a for-loop with am array assignment to array assignment
 * body and an unrolling factor of 2. Furthermore, it
 * is a simpler test in that the bounds are already
 * known, no dependencies, and the upper bound is
 * divisible by the factor.
